# MicroPython I2S Examples

This repository provides MicroPython example code, showing how to use the I2S protocol with development boards supporting MicroPython.  The I2S protocol can be used to play WAV audio files through a speaker or headphone, or to record microphone audio to a WAV file on a SD card. 

The examples are supported on 3 ports:  STM32, ESP32, RP2.  

To use I2S with MicroPython on the Pyboards, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico you will need to use a version of MicroPython that supports I2S.  For Pyboards and the ESP32 the v1.17 release and nightly builds support I2S.  For the Raspberry Pi Pico, the nightly builds support I2S, but not the v1.17 release.  MicroPython binaries can be found [here](https://micropython.org/download/).

The I2S feature is currently in a Technology Preview phase and may undergo changes as feedback is received from users.

#### Quick Start - play an audio tone through ear phones
The easiest way to get started with I2S is playing a pure tone to ear phones using a DAC board such as the I2S UDA1334A breakout board or the I2S PCM5102 Stereo DAC Decoder board.  Here are the steps:

1. Download and program the appropriate firmware that supports the I2S protocol into the MicroPython development board
1. Load the example code `play_tone.py` into a text editor, found in the [examples](examples) folder
1. Make the following wiring connections using a quality breadboard and jumper wires.  Use the GPIO pins that are listed in the example code file.  Refer to the section on `Hardware Wiring Recommendations` below.

    |UDA1334A board pin|Pyboard V1.1 pin|Pyboard D pin|ESP32 pin|Pico Pin|
    |--|--|--|--|--|
    |3V0|3V3|3V3|3V3|3V3|
    |GND|GND|GND|GND|GND|
    |BCLK|Y6|Y6|32|16|
    |WSEL|Y5|Y5|25|17|
    |DIN|Y8|Y8|33|18|

    |PCM5102 board pin|Pyboard V1.1 pin|Pyboard D pin|ESP32 pin|Pico Pin|
    |--|--|--|--|--|
    |VIN|3V3|3V3|3V3|3V3|
    |GND|GND|GND|GND|GND|
    |SCK|GND|GND|GND|GND|
    |BCK|Y6|Y6|32|16|
    |LCK|Y5|Y5|25|17|
    |DIN|Y8|Y8|33|18|
    
1. Establish a REPL connection to the board
1. Copy the code from the editor e.g.  ctrl-A, ctrl-C
1. Ctrl-E in the REPL
1. Paste code into the REPL
1. Ctrl-D in the REPL to run the code
1. Result: the tone should play in the ear phones
1. Try different tone frequencies

#### Easy WAV Player example
The file `easy_wav_player.py` contains an easy-to-use micropython example for playing WAV files.  This example requires
an SD card (to store the WAV files).  Pyboards have a built in SD card.  Some ESP32 development boards have a built-in SD Card, such as the Lolin D32 Pro.  Other devices, such as the TinyPico and Raspberry Pi Pico require an external SD card module to be wired in.  Additionally, for the Raspberry Pi Pico [sdcard.py](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/drivers/sdcard/sdcard.py) needs to be copied to the Pico's filesystem to enable SD card support.

Instructions
1. Wire up the hardware.  e.g.  connect the I2S playback module to the development board, and connect an external SD Card Module (if needed).  See tips on hardware wiring below.  The example uses the default GPIO pins outlined above.  These can 
be customized, if needed.
1. copy file `wavplayer.py` to the internal flash file system using a command line tool such as ampy or rshell.
1. copy the WAV file(s) you want to play to an SD card.  Plug the SD card into the SD card Module.
1. configure the file `easy_wav_player.py` to specify the WAV file(s) to play
1. copy the file `easy_wav_player.py` to the internal flash file system using a command line tool such as ampy or rshell.
1. run `easy_wav_player.py` by importing the file into the REPL.  e.g.  import easy_wav_player
1. try various ways of playing a WAV file, using the `pause()`, `resume()`, and `stop()` methods

MP3 files can be converted to WAV files using online applications such as
[online-convert](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav)

WAV file tag data can be inspected using a downloadable application such as
[MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo).
This application is useful to check the sample rate, stereo versus mono, and sample bit size (16, 24, or 32 bits)

#### Pyboard GPIO mappings for SCK, WS, SD

On Pyboard devices I2S compatible GPIO pins are mapped to a specific I2S hardware bus.  The tables below show this mapping.  For example, the GPIO pin "Y6" can only be used with I2S ID=2. 

Pyboard D with MicroPython WBUS-DIP28 adapter

|I2S ID|SCK pin|WS pin|SD pin|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|X6,W29|X5,W16|Y4|
|2|Y1,Y6,Y9|Y3,Y5|Y8,W24|

Pyboard V1.0/V1.1

|I2S ID|SCK pin|WS pin|SD pin|
|--|--|--|--|
|2|Y6,Y9|Y4,Y5|Y8,X22|

#### ESP32 GPIO mappings for SCK, WS, SD

All ESP32 GPIO pins can be used for I2S, with attention to special cases:
*   GPIO34 to GPIO39 are input-only
*   GPIO strapping pins:  see note below on using strapping pins

Strapping Pin consideration:
The following ESP32 GPIO strapping pins should be **used with caution**.  There is a risk that the state of the attached hardware can affect the boot sequence.  When possible, use other GPIO pins.
*   GPIO0 - used to detect boot-mode.  Bootloader runs when pin is low during powerup. Internal pull-up resistor.
*   GPIO2 - used to enter serial bootloader.  Internal pull-down resistor.
*   GPIO4 - technical reference indicates this is a strapping pin, but usage is not described.  Internal pull-down resistor.
*   GPIO5 - used to configure SDIO Slave.  Internal pull-up resistor.
*   GPIO12 - used to select flash voltage.  Internal pull-down resistor.
*   GPIO15 - used to configure silencing of boot messages.  Internal pull-up resistor.

#### Raspberry Pi Pico GPIO mappings for SCK, WS, SD

All Pico GPIO pins can be used for I2S, with one limitation.  The WS pin number must be one greater than the SCK pin number. 

### Hardware Wiring Recommendations

I have found the best audio quality is acheived when:

1. wires are short
1. modules are connected with header pins and 10cm long female-female jumpers, OR
1. solid core 22 AWG wire

### Explaining the I2S protocol with buckets and water

The I2S protocol is different than other protocols such as I2C and SPI.  Those protocols are transactional.  A controller requests data from a peripheral and waits for a reply.  I2S is a streaming protocol. Data flows continuously, ideally without gaps.

It's interesting to use a water and bucket analogy for the MicroPython I2S implementation.  Consider writing a DAC using I2S.  The internal buffer(ibuf) can be considered as a large bucket of water, with a hole in the bottom that drains the bucket. The water streaming out of the bottom is analogous to the flow of audio samples going into the I2S hardware. That flow must be constant and at a fixed rate. The user facing buffer is like a small bucket that is used to fill the large bucket. In the case of I2S writes, the small bucket is used to transport audio samples from a Wav file "lake" and fill the large bucket (ibuf). Imagine a person using the small bucket to move audio samples from the Wav file to the large bucket;  if the large bucket becomes full, the person might go do another task, and come back later to see if there is more room in the large bucket.  When they return, if there is space in the large bucket, they will pour some more water (samples) into the large bucket.  Initially, the large buffer is empty. Almost immediately after water is poured into the large bucket audio samples stream out of the bottom and sound is heard almost immediately.  After the last small bucket is poured into the large bucket it will take some time to drain the large bucket -- sound will be heard for some amount of time after the last small bucket is poured in.

If the person is too slow to refill the large bucket it will run dry and the water flow stops, a condition called "underflow" -- there will be a gap in sound produced.

Does a water analogy help to explain I2S?  comments welcome !

### FAQ
Q: Are there sizing guidelines for the internal buffer (ibuf)?   
A: A good starting point is to size the ibuf = 2x user buffer size.   For example, if the user buffer is 10kB, ibuf could be sized at 20kB.  If gaps are detected in the audio sample stream increasing the size of ibuf may mitigate these gaps. 

Q: How many seconds of audio data is held in the internal buffer (ibuf)?   
A: T[seconds] = ibuf-size-in-bytes / sample-rate-in-samples-per-second / num-channels / sample-size-in-bytes    
stereo = 2 channels, mono = 1 channel.

Q: Are there sizing guidelines for the user buffer?  
A: Smaller sizes will favour efficient use of heap space, but suffer from the inherent inefficiency of more switching between filling and emptying.  A larger user buffer size suffers from a longer time of processing the samples or time to fill from a SD card - this longer time may block critical time functions from running.  A good starting point is a user buffer of 5kB.

Q: What conditions causes gaps in the sample stream?  
A: For writes to a DAC, a gap will happen when the internal buffer is filled at a slower rate than samples being sent to the I2S DAC.  This is called underflow.  For reads from a microphone, a gap will happen when the internal buffer is emptied at a slower rate than sample data is being read from the microphone.  This is called overflow.

Q: Does the MicroPython I2S class support devices that need a MCLK signal?  
A: No.  Supported I2S devices create an internally generated MCLK using the SCK or WS signals and a PLL.

#### Workaround for Adafruit I2S MEMS Microphone Breakout - SPH0645LM4H
This is a well designed breakout board based on the SPH0645LM4H microphone device. Users need to be aware that the SPH0645LM4H device implements non-standard Philips I2S timing.  When used with the ESP32, all audio samples coming from the I2S microphone are shifted to the left by one bit. This increases the sound level by 6dB. More details on this problem are outlined a [StreetSense project log](https://hackaday.io/project/162059-street-sense/log/160705-new-i2s-microphone).  
Workaround:  Use the static I2S class method `shift()` to right shift all samples that are read from the microphone.
